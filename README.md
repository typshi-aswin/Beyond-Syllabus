## 🚀 What is Beyond Syllabus?

**Beyond Syllabus** is the **front-end interface** for the open-source [WikiSyllabus](https://github.com/The-Purple-Movement/WikiSyllabus) repository — a platform that transforms any syllabus into an **interactive AI-powered learning companion**.

It’s like **ChatGPT for your syllabus** — but built with **purpose**.  
Designed for **students, teachers, and lifelong learners**, it answers deeper questions such as:

- **Why am I learning this?**
- **Where can it be applied in the real world?**
- **Explain it with relatable examples.**
- **What opportunities exist in this field?**
- **Which industries and innovations connect to it?**
- **How is it evolving in the AI-powered world?**

With Beyond Syllabus, learning becomes **context-rich, curiosity-driven, and future-focused**.

## 💡 Why We Exist

Too many students fall into the trap of **skip-learning** — cramming only what’s needed for the exam and forgetting it all afterwards. This creates:

❌ Weak conceptual foundations  
❌ No ability to connect knowledge across subjects  
❌ Poor readiness for AI-driven careers  

We’re building a **movement against rote memorisation and closed-book examinations**.  
Our vision is a world where:

✅ Students ask better questions  
✅ Teachers inspire understanding, not just coverage  
✅ Learning connects to **industry, innovation, and purpose**
