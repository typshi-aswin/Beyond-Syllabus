# MAT204: Probability, Random Processes and Numerical Methods  

## Course Objectives  
* Understand the concept, properties and important models of discrete random variables and analyse suitable random phenomena.  
* Understand the concept, properties and important models of continuous random variables and analyse suitable random phenomena.  
* Analyse random processes using autocorrelation, power spectrum and Poisson process model as appropriate.  
* Compute roots of equations, evaluate definite integrals and perform interpolation on given numerical data using standard numerical techniques.  
* Apply standard numerical techniques for solving systems of equations, fitting curves on numerical data and solving ordinary differential equations.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Discrete Probability Distributions (9 Hours)  
* Discrete random variables and probability distributions.

* Independent random variables, expectation for multiple random variables.  

### Module 2 – Continuous Probability Distributions (9 Hours)  
* Continuous random variables and probability distributions.  
* Expectation, mean, variance.  
* Uniform, exponential, and normal distributions.  
* Continuous bivariate distributions, marginal distributions.
