# PHT110: Engineering Physics B (For Non-Circuit Branches)

## Course Objectives
* Compute the quantitative aspects of waves and oscillations in engineering systems.  
* Apply the interaction of light with matter through interference, diffraction and identify these phenomena in natural optical processes and optical instruments.  
* Analyze the behaviour of matter in the atomic and subatomic level through the principles of quantum mechanics to understand microscopic processes in electronic devices.  
* Apply the knowledge of ultrasonics in non-destructive testing and use the principles of acoustics for safe and healthy environments.  
* Apply knowledge of laser and fibre optic communication systems in various engineering applications.  

## Course Content
