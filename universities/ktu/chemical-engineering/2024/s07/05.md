# PECHT746: Advanced Heat and Mass Transfer

## Course Objectives
* Analyze the phenomena of heat and mass transfer for engineering design applications.
* Understand that heat and mass transfer processes share similar mathematical models in diffusion and convection.
* Recognize that in certain cases (e.g., humidification, drying) heat and mass transfer must be considered jointly.
* Solve engineering problems involving conduction, convection, diffusion mass transfer, interphase mass transfer, and simultaneous heat and mass transfer.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Analyze steady and transient heat conduction with and without heat generation.  
* **CO 2:** Evaluate forced and free convection processes and their boundary layer characteristics.  
* **CO 3:** Apply principles of diffusional mass transfer in various media.  
* **CO 4:** Understand interphase mass transfer and two-resistance theory.  
* **CO 5:** Analyze simultaneous heat and mass transfer phenomena.  
* **CO 6:** Solve engineering problems involving combined heat and mass transfer mechanisms.
