# PECHT752: Non-Conventional Petroleum Resources

## Course Objectives
* Identify the formation and geographic distribution of non-conventional hydrocarbon resources.  
* Understand and characterize source and reservoir rocks.  
* Study the basic principles of conversion of coal and gas to oil.  
---
## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Explain the geology, origin, and occurrence of heavy oil, extra heavy oil, tar sands, and oil shale.  
* **CO 2:** Understand the formation, properties, exploration, and production of shale gas.  
* **CO 3:** Describe the formation, thermodynamics, and production of coal bed methane (CBM).  
* **CO 4:** Understand gas hydrates, their properties, exploration, and extraction methods.  
* **CO 5:** Apply principles of coal and gas conversion to oil, considering environmental and economic aspects.
