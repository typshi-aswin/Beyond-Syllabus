### Module 2 Fluid Flow Equations and Pumps 
- Continuity equation, macroscopic momentum balance, Navier–Stokes equation (concept only).  
- Bernoulli’s equation with kinetic energy correction factor, corrections for fluid friction, pump work, and compressible flow.  
- Laminar flow in conduits – shear stress, velocity distribution, maximum and average velocity, Hagen–Poiseuille equation, friction factor–Reynolds number relationship.

### Module 3 Turbulent Flow, Piping Systems, and Flow Measurement  
- Turbulent flow in pipes – universal velocity distribution, friction factor relations (Nikuradse, Karman, Blasius), Prandtl one-seventh power law, Moody chart.  
- Pipe and tubing types, joints, fittings, valves (gate, globe, diaphragm, butterfly, ball, check valves), equivalent length.

### Module 4 Boundary Layer, Packed and Fluidized Beds 
- Boundary layer formation in straight tubes, separation, and wake formation.  
- Flow past immersed bodies – drag coefficient, terminal settling velocity in different regimes.  
- Solid–fluid contacting: packed beds (Ergun equation, Kozeny–Carman, Burke–Plummer), fluidization (phenomenon, regimes, types).
