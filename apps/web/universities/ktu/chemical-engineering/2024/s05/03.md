# PCCHT503 - Chemical Reaction Engineering

## Course Objectives

1. Enable students to apply the principles of chemical kinetics to describe the rates of chemical reactions for isothermal and non-isothermal reactions.  
2. Equip the students with fundamental knowledge for the design of different types of ideal reactors, including batch, continuous-stirred tank reactors (CSTR), plug-flow reactors (PFR) for single and multiple reactions.  
3. Impart the concepts such as residence time distribution (RTD) and models required to analyze and design real reactors.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1  
**Overview of Chemical Reaction Engineering**  
- Classification of chemical reactions, variables affecting the rate of reaction, definition of reaction rate.
