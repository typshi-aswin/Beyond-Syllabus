# EST102: Programming in C

## Course Objectives
* Analyze a computational problem and develop an algorithm/flowchart to find its solution.  
* Develop readable C programs with branching and looping statements, using arithmetic, logical, relational or bitwise operators.  
* Write readable C programs with arrays, structures or unions for storing data to be processed.  
* Divide a given computational problem into modules and develop a readable multi-function C program using recursion if required.  
* Write readable C programs using pointers for array processing and parameter passing.  
* Develop readable C programs with files for reading input and storing output.  

## Course Content

### Module 1 – Basics of Computer Hardware and Software
* Basics of computer architecture: processor, memory, input & output devices.  
* Application software & system software: compilers, interpreters, high-level and low-level languages.  
* Introduction to structured programming approach.  
* Flowcharts, algorithms, pseudocode (bubble sort, linear search – algorithms and pseudocode).  

### Module 2 – Program Basics
* **C Program Structure:** character set, tokens, identifiers, variables, data types, constants.  
* **Console I/O operations:** `printf` and `scanf`.  
* **Operators and Expressions:** arithmetic, relational, logical, conditional, size of, assignment, bitwise operators, precedence.  
* **Control Flow Statements:** `if`, `switch`, `goto`, loops (`while`, `do-while`, `for`), `break`, `continue`.  
* Simple programs covering control flow.  

### Module 3 – Arrays and Strings
* Arrays: declaration and initialization, 1D and 2D arrays.  
* String processing: in-built string functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`, `puts`, `gets`).  
* Programs: linear search, bubble sort, simple programs using arrays and strings.  

### Module 4 – Working with Functions
* Modular programming, writing functions, formal and actual parameters.  
* Parameter passing (pass by value), recursion.  
* Arrays as function parameters.  
* Structures, unions, storage classes, scope and lifetime of variables.  
* Simple programs using functions.  

### Module 5 – Pointers and Files
* Basics of pointers: declaration, accessing data, NULL pointers, array access using pointers, pass by reference.  
* **File Operations:** open, close, read, write, append.  
* Sequential and random access to files.  
* In-built file handling functions: `rewind()`, `fseek()`, `ftell()`, `feof()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`.  
* Simple programs using pointers and files.
