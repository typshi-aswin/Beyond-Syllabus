# PCCST302: Theory of Computation


## Course Objectives

1. To introduce the concept of formal languages.  
2. To discuss the Chomsky classification of formal languages with grammar and automata for regular, context-free, context-sensitive, and unrestricted languages.  
3. To discuss the notions of decidability and the halting problem.
