## Course Modules

### Module 1: Discrete Random Variables
- Random variables, discrete random variables and their probability distributions.
- Cumulative distribution function, expectation, mean and variance.
- Binomial and Poisson distributions.
- Poisson as a limit of binomial distribution.
- Joint pmf, marginal pmf, independence, expected value of a function of two variables.  

### Module 2: Continuous Random Variables
- Continuous distributions: uniform, normal, exponential.
- CDF, expectation, mean and variance.
- Joint pdf, marginal pdf, independent variables, expectation of functions.  

### Module 3: Limit Theorems and Stochastic Processes
- Markov’s and Chebyshev’s inequalities.
- Strong Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem (without proofs).
- Stochastic processes: discrete-time, continuous-time, counting processes.
- Poisson process, interarrival times.  

### Module 4: Markov Chains
- Random walk, Chapman–Kolmogorov equations.
- State classification: irreducible, recurrent, transient.
- Long-run proportions.
