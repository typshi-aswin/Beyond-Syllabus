## SEMESTER S1
# PHYSICS FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND LIFE SCIENCE
**Course Code:** GDPHT101  

## Course Objectives
1. To provide students with a solid background in the fundamentals of Physics and impart this knowledge in Physical Science and Life Science disciplines.  
2. To develop scientific attitudes and enable students to correlate Physics concepts with their core programs.  
3. To equip students with practical knowledge that complements their theoretical studies and develop their ability to create practical applications and solutions in engineering based on their understanding of Physics.
