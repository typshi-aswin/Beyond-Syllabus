# EST100: Engineering Mechanics

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamental concepts of mechanics applicable to engineering.
* To develop the ability to analyze and solve problems involving rigid bodies under static and dynamic equilibrium.
* To familiarize students with the use of vector mathematics and graphical methods for mechanics problems.
* To lay the foundation for understanding structural and mechanical system behavior in real-world applications.
