# PECHT632 - Petroleum Refinery Engineering

## Course Objectives

1. Present an overview of the modern, integrated petroleum refinery, its feed stocks, products and the processes employed to convert crude oil and intermediate streams into finished products.  
2. Provide major insights into both primary and secondary processes—Atmospheric Distillation, Vacuum Distillation, Cracking, Hydrocracking, Catalytic Reforming—in a typical refinery.
