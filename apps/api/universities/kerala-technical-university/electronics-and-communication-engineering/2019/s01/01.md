# MAT201: Linear Algebra and Calculus

## Course Objectives
* To equip students with the fundamental concepts of linear algebra and multivariable calculus.
* To enable students to solve systems of equations and perform matrix operations including diagonalization and classification of quadratic forms.
* To develop the ability to analyze and interpret multivariable functions using derivatives, integrals, and series.
* To build a strong foundation in convergence of infinite series and applications of Taylor and Fourier series in engineering problems.
