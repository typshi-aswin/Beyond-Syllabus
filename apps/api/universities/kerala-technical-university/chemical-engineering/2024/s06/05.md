# PECHT633 - Heterogeneous Reactions and Catalysis

## Course Objectives

1. Explain basic principles and theories of heterogeneous catalysis, including adsorption, desorption, surface reactions, and diffusion processes.  
2. Develop an understanding of reaction kinetics in heterogeneous catalysis.  
3. Acquire skills in various techniques for catalyst preparation and characterisation.
